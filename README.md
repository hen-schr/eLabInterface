This module provides basic functionalities for interacting with eLabFTW experiment entries, reading their data and metadata in an easy way. It makes use of the python API that is provided by eLabFTW itself, but attempts to make the workflow of importing and processing the ELN data more user-friendly and generally applicable. The main features include the possibility to request experimental 
as well as process the data within them to facilitate their further analysis or reporting. Essentially, this is intended to provide a basis to enable the use of eLabFTW as a central repository for all data attached to an experiment. At the moment, this is only a proof-of-concept, that has to be improved and expanded before being ready to be integrated into any actual RDM workflows.

DISCLAIMER: This package was not developed by a professional software developer. Although I am trying to adhere to best practice, document my code and implement some tests, the code and architecture might not be the best and may contain some bugs. If you have any comments or suggestions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
